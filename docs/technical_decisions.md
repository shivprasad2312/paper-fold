# KUBIK — Technical Decision Log

ADR-style. Status: all **Accepted** and implemented (v1.0.0).

## ADR-001 — three.js + Vite, no app framework
**Decision:** three.js for 3D; Vite for dev/build; plain ES modules
elsewhere; zero other runtime dependencies.
**Why:** the game is one 3D scene + one DOM overlay. A framework (React,
Vue, Svelte) would own the HUD for no benefit — the HUD is 90 lines of
direct DOM. three.js is the only library that earns its bundle size.
**Consequences:** +tiny bundle, +offline-friendly, +readable codebase;
−we hand-write the HUD (fine), −no framework ecosystem for UI (unneeded).

## ADR-002 — Discrete tile-grid movement, NOT a physics engine
**Decision:** the world is a `Map<"x,z", tile>` heightfield; a roll is a
legal-move check + fixed 0.17 s animation. No gravity integrator, no AABB
solver, no continuous collision detection.
**Why (decisive):** (1) **fairness** — the genre's #1 player value is "I
died because I failed, not because of precision" (research §3); discrete
moves make every death a graph-theoretic fact; (2) **provability** — the
same `checkRoll` powers the verifier that *proves* solvability, soft-lock
freedom, and par; a physics sim can't be proven, only sampled; (3)
**performance** — zero per-frame physics, deterministic on any device;
(4) **feel is recoverable** — the 0.17 s eased roll + bump-back + wind hop
read as physical while being 100% deterministic.
**Trade-offs accepted:** no free-rolling off an edge at an angle (the roll
is always 90° — by design, it's the game's grammar); no stacking of
objects; no momentum. None of these are in the design.
**Complexity:** O(1) per move (Map lookup); O(V) per verifier pass.

## ADR-003 — Zero binary assets
**Decision:** no image/audio/font/level-data files. Slab geometry merged
at load; glow textures generated in `textures.js`; soundtrack + SFX
synthesized in Web Audio; all levels are JS data.
**Why:** (1) offline + private + tiny; (2) every visual/sound is a
function → themeable (2 full skins from one palette table); (3) the
"content = code" model is what lets the generator *prove* levels; (4)
nothing to leak, scrape, or re-licence.
**Trade-offs:** no hand-painted art; sound is generated (deliberate:
calm, metronome-grade, no sample identity issues).

## ADR-004 — Levels are static, proven data — generated offline, not at runtime
**Decision:** 13 hand levels + 37 campaign levels generated *offline* by
`gen-campaign.mjs` (seeded PRNG, rejection sampling until the verifier
passes), committed as static `src/campaign.js`. Dailies are generated at
load (date-seeded) and proven at load by the same verifier.
**Why:** runtime procedural content in a fairness-critical game is
liability (impossible level = unfixable in the field). Offline
generation gives the authoring speed of procedural content with the
guarantee of hand content. Rejection-until-proven means "generator output
is always legal" is a *property*, not a hope.
**Trade-offs:** campaign is fixed until regenerated (fine — it's a
campaign); the generator must stay in the repo (it is) so new levels
follow the same proof.

## ADR-005 — Pure-Node rule core (`rules.js`) as the testability boundary
**Decision:** every legality question lives in `rules.js`, free of
`three.js`, DOM, timers, and RNG.
**Why:** the verifier (50+14 levels, 7 checks), the unit tests, the
generator, and the playable-route bot all compose it. It is the single
source of truth for "is this move legal" — `game.js` and the in-page BFS
in tests import the *same* constants (`MAX_DROP`, `MAX_CLIMB`), so the
proof and the play can't disagree about the rules.
**Consequence:** if a rule changes, every consumer updates through one
file and the full gate must pass.

## ADR-006 — Headless-Chromium QA via puppeteer-core + @sparticuz/chromium
**Decision:** all browser tests (playable-route, playtest, stress,
regression, perf) run in headless Chromium with SwiftShader
software rendering.
**Why:** real input path + real render path, no display, no GPU, CI-safe.
@sparticuz/chromium ships a self-contained headless shell;
`puppeteer-core` adds no browser download. In the sandbox we point it at
locally-built NSS libs (auto in the test scripts; no-op on CI where the
OS provides them).
**Trade-offs:** SwiftShader numbers understate real-GPU performance —
perf budgets are set with that in mind (see performance_report.md);
software-rendered headless can't validate aesthetics → screenshot review
in `docs/` is the visual gate.

## ADR-007 — localStorage save with defaults-merge migration
**Decision:** one JSON blob in localStorage; `loadSave()` merges over
`DEFAULTS` and catches parse failure → fresh save. New fields default
automatically; no version field.
**Why:** zero-backend, per-device, and the failure mode (corrupt save)
must never crash the game — a reflex game that eats your progress at the
wrong moment is dead. Defaults-merge makes every schema extension
backwards-compatible by construction (`unlocked` became an inert legacy
field this way when all levels opened).
**Trade-offs:** no cross-device sync, no anti-cheat (irrelevant offline;
medals are local mastery, not competition).

## ADR-008 — Synthesized Web Audio (no samples)
**Decision:** `AudioEngine` builds pad/arp/SFX from oscillators +
noise + filters at runtime; per-level seed so each level sounds distinct.
**Why:** ADR-003 consistency; Web Audio latency is fine for this game
(SFX are non-critical); zero files.
**Trade-offs:** CPU cost of synthesis (measured negligible, see
performance_report.md); no "signature" sound identity (acceptable).

## ADR-009 — Presentation clocks for slider bridges
**Decision:** rising-bridge "is it up now?" is computed from the view's
animation clock (`levelView.sliderUp`), which `game.js::isSolid` queries.
**Why:** sliders are *visual* timing hazards — the player's reference is
what the slabs do on screen. The clock starts at level load and the game
reads it, so logic and presentation share one time base (no drift, no
"the slab looked up but the logic said no").
**Trade-off (accepted, documented):** one place where presentation owns a
gameplay clock. It is pure math (sin of time, period, phase) and is
verified: the verifier models sliders as *always solid* (worst case for
route existence) while the playable bot plays them frozen — together they
bound both failure modes (a route that needs a timing window exists in
the always-solid proof; a timing window that doesn't exist can't hide a
dead level).

## ADR-010 — Two-bar test gate on every commit (verifier + playable bot)
**Decision:** `npm test` = unit tests + pure-Node verifier (route,
push/crumble survival, soft-lock, spawn safety, shard reachability, par)
+ a bot that *plays* all 50 levels + today's daily to `won` through real
keyboard input. Wired as a git pre-commit hook and GitHub Actions CI.
**Why:** the genre's recurring shipped defects (EDGE: crash on a moving-
block level; janky block interactions; unresponsive swipes — research
§6) are exactly the defects a play-to-completion gate catches. Making it
a *commit blocker* (not a nightly check) means a broken level cannot
exist on the branch at all.
**Trade-offs:** commit time ≈ 4 min (accepted: the alternative is
shipping broken levels); CI cost ≈ 5 min per push (accepted).

## ADR-011 — All 50 levels open from the start
**Decision (2026-11-06, player-directed):** no progression gating.
`save.unlocked` retained in schema (inert). Reverting = 2 lines in
`openLevels()`.
**Why:** player preference for mastery-routing over lockout; also removes
an entire failure surface (unreachable-card bugs) and simplifies the
playtest (every card must be open).
**Trade-offs:** no enforced difficulty curve (mitigated by level-select
ordering + act structure; curve is now a suggestion, not a wall).

## ADR-012 — Timing-fairness gate: every sentinel crossing must have a ≥ 0.5 s window (2026-11-06)
**Context:** the player reported L46 "The Wall Walks" was unfinishable —
the moving sentinel on the only corridor left no time to cross
(BUG-003). The verifier modelled sentinels *absent* and the live bot had
never been run against every level, so a periodic hazard could seal the
sole route and nothing caught it. Pre-fix, **22 of 50** campaign levels
had at least one crossing window below 0.5 s.

**Decision:** add a crossing-window model to `src/rules.js` (algorithms
§6.1) and make it a **third bar** of the commit gate:
- `candidateCrossings` — BFS over the line graph, depth ≤ 4: straight
  runs, L-shapes and 2-row patrol bands (the L12 geometry) are all
  enumerable candidates.
- `crossingWindow` — fine-grained simulation over one joint orb period;
  an orb counts only if its patrol is within Chebyshev 1 of the path.
- `TIMING_FLOOR = 0.5 s` — a window is *fair* iff it is at least this
  long (≈ one roll of reaction margin; the old L46 measured 0.36 s).
- `fairCrossingGraph` + `timingProblems` — the verifier (check 8)
  requires a fair path start→goal, and for `gateKey` levels proves
  start→key and key→goal **separately** via `keyNode` graph waypoints
  (BUG-004: L12's key sat behind a crossing the old generator could not
  even see). Crossing candidates are additionally filtered by the roll
  law — a burst whose entry/exit roll is a blocked climb (or a void
  step) is not a route, even with a wide window (BUG-007: L39).
- The generator (`gen-campaign`, `gen-daily`) retries layouts until the
  gate is green; crumble slabs are placed **after** sentinels and never
  on a patrol line or adjacent to one (BUG-005: L15's crumble sat on the
  only crossing entry — waiting there was a slab-break gamble).
- The live playable bot plans over the **same** `fairCrossingGraph` and
  commits each line run as one gap-free burst (pre-queued continuation
  rolls, no pause on the patrol line).

**Why 0.5 s and not "any positive window":** the cube's crossing speed
is fixed by `ROLL_TIME`; a positive but tiny window is only fair for
frame-perfect input, which the player cannot reliably produce (EDGE's
own reviews cite control jank — research §6). 0.5 s is the smallest
margin a human can hold across one roll at the slowest shipped orb
speed.

**Trade-offs:**
- verify time: 12.1 s (was <1 s) — accepted, it is the core promise of
  "no unfinishable level"; the relevant-orb filter keeps multi-orb
  levels cheap.
- generated levels re-rolled under the gate (37 layouts regenerated,
  all re-verified + spot-checked live); hand-authored L1–L13 untouched
  (L12 passed as authored once band crossings became visible).
- the bot is now stricter than a human: it plays the *verified* route
  with perfect window reads, so "bot passes" is a necessary-not-sufficient
  reading of "human can finish" — the verifier's exhaustive-in-time
  windows are the actual fairness claim; the bot proves the game's
  *runtime* (render clock, input queue, crumble timers) agrees with the
  sim at frame rate.
